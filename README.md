# Artificial Intelligence Attitude and Literacy Framework (AI-ALF)

### Introduction

The advent of Artificial Intelligence as an integral part of our lives is no longer a prediction, but a reality. 

As AI technology continues to advance and permeate various sectors of society, it has profound implications on our interaction with the world, our workplaces, and our economic and organisational structures. 

Against this backdrop, understanding and navigating the rapidly changing landscape of AI becomes crucial for every individual, regardless of their technical background or digital proficiency.

### Purpose

The aim of this framework is twofold:

Firstly, it seeks categorize the diverse perspectives and levels of acceptance individuals have towards AI through the 'Attitude' dimension. From fatalists to enthusiasts, each attitude towards AI provides unique insights into how people perceive and interact with this technology.

Recognizing these diverse perspectives fosters an inclusive discourse around AI and its impacts, promoting societal resilience and adaptability in an era of accelerating technological change.

Secondly, the framework, through the Literacy dimension, provides a taxonomy to understand where an individual sits in regards to their level of awareness and knowledge of AI systems. This dimension helps identify the varying degrees of comprehension about AI within the population, ranging from those unaware of its existence to experts deeply ingrained in its workings. 

By mapping out the diverse spectrum of AI literacy in the population, from the unaware to the experts, we can gain a clearer picture of the existing landscape of AI knowledge. Identifying knowledge gaps is key to informing where educational efforts should be focused to improve AI literacy across society. Additionally, understanding the varying levels of comprehension can help policy-makers design regulations and guidelines that are in line with the public's understanding of AI, ensuring their relevance and effectiveness.

In the context of AI development, a comprehensive understanding of the public's knowledge about AI can inform the creation of more user-friendly and accessible AI technologies. By acknowledging and catering to the differing levels of AI literacy in the population, AI developers can design systems that are easily comprehensible and usable by a wide range of people.

The categories within this framework, both in the Attitude and Literacy dimensions, are not meant to be strict boxes that rigidly define an individual's stance or level of understanding towards AI. Instead, they should be viewed as points along a spectrum, representing a gradient of attitudes and knowledge.

Individuals may not fit perfectly into one category, but may instead exhibit characteristics from several categories. For example, someone might be a 'sceptic' with a hint of 'pessimism' or an 'optimist' who also embodies elements of 'utopian' vision. Similarly, in the Knowledge dimension, someone might be 'aware' of AI but also show the inquisitive nature characteristic of 'beginners'.

This fluidity reflects the complexity and diversity of human understanding and attitudes towards AI. The aim of this framework is not to compartmentalize, but rather to provide a broad understanding of where individuals or groups might predominantly align in terms of their AI acceptance and understanding. It is designed to foster dialogue, guide education and policy, and encourage inclusivity and diversity in the AI space.


### Ethics

By publishing this framework, we intend to underscore the significance of the collective contribution to the development of AI, and stress that every perspective matters. As AI continues to evolve and impact our lives in myriad ways, it is imperative that its development is informed by a diverse array of perspectives.

Firstly, we must respect different opinions. The spectrum of views from fatalists to utopians provides us with a wide lens to examine the possible societal implications of AI, helping us foresee potential challenges and address them proactively. Every perspective, whether critical or supportive, adds a unique dimension to the ongoing conversation about AI.

Secondly, we must respect different levels of knowledge about AI, from the unaware to the experts. Understanding where individuals or groups sit on this spectrum allows us to identify where knowledge gaps exist and where resources might be most effectively allocated to improve AI literacy.

Finally, it is within our collective power to contribute to the increase of knowledge about AI. We all have a role in promoting transparency, accessibility, and understanding of AI. This can be achieved through education, open discussions, or the development of user-friendly AI technologies. By sharing knowledge and encouraging exploration of AI, we empower each other to engage critically with this technology, fostering a more informed and resilient society.

We aspire to a society that is not only informed about AI, but also actively engages in discussions about its ethical, social, and economic impacts. 

### Call to action

This framework serves as a call to action for everyone to contribute to shaping the future of AI. It advocates for inclusivity, diversity, respect, and collective growth, all of which are crucial for navigating our synthetic age responsibly and equitably.

By ensuring a diverse set of stakeholders contribute to the development of AI, like generative models, we can ensure the resultant technology is more robust, fair, and representative of the global society it serves.
