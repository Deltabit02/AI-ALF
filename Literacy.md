## Literacy

The objective of the Literacy dimension is to assess the level of understanding and awareness individuals have about AI technology. It aims to classify individuals based on their knowledge level, from Unaware to Expert. This dimension can identify knowledge gaps in different population segments and help tailor educational efforts accordingly. Understanding this dimension can also contribute to the development of more user-friendly AI applications by identifying common misunderstandings or knowledge deficiencies. It can guide efforts to improve public understanding of AI, which is key to informed public discourse and policy-making around AI technology.

**Unaware**: Individuals with no knowledge of AI and possibly no awareness of its existence or relevance.

**Aware**: Individuals who are aware of AI as a concept but do not yet have a detailed understanding.

**Beginner**: Individuals who have a basic understanding of AI, perhaps through general media or basic education.

**Intermediate**: Individuals who understand some of the technical aspects of AI and could describe a range of applications, but may not have a comprehensive understanding or be able to apply it practically.

**Knowledgeable**: These individuals have a solid understanding of AI, beyond just curiosity. They are well-informed and comfortable with AI concepts and applications, perhaps through study or professional experience, but are not necessarily experts in the field.

**Expert**: Individuals with a deep, sophisticated understanding of AI, likely through formal education or professional experience.
